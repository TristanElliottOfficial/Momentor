## Configuration Notes:
-----------------------

Front End ( config ):

1. Tailwindcss:
-----------------------
Using the tailwindcss utility framework makes component design easy and readable. How ever there are downsides to using Tailwindcss, there is no Javascript for an interactive,
user interface. Thats why we wen with Vue.js instead of Laravel Blade Component feature.

2. Vue.js
-----------------------
We went with the Vue.js preset option provided by the ````` composer require laravel/ui ````` because the React framework is for larger projects. If you would like to use the
React framework then use our artisan command.
